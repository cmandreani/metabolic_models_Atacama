# Modeling the emergent metabolic potential of soil microbiomes in Atacama landscapes

This script runs the analyses and plots included in the article by CM Andreani-Gerard et al (2025).
Briefly, our work simulates the metabolic potential of prokaryotic communities from six constrasting sites of the Talabre-LejÃ­a transect, in the Atacama Desert, under five nutritional scenarios.
For this, we used sequence data from whole communities and MAGs that enabled us to build community-wide and genome-resolved metabolic models.
We refer to the results of the simulations (combining six sites, two datasets, and five seeds) as "scopes" which consist of lists of metabolites predicted to be producible.
