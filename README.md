# This script runs the analyses and plots included in the article "Modeling the emergent metabolic potential of soil microbiomes in Atacama landscapes".

Briefly, our work simulates the metabolic potential of prokaryotic communities from six constrasting sites of the Talabre-Lej√≠a transect (Atacama Desert).
