# This script runs the analyses and plots included in the article "Modeling the emergent metabolic potential of soil microbiomes in Atacama landscapes".

# Briefly, our work simulates the metabolic potential of prokaryotic communities from six constrasting sites of the Talabre-Lej√≠a transect (Atacama Desert). 
# simulations, scopes, conditions, M2M

# 1) BACKGROUND OF THE TLT
#    1.1 Environmental metadata
#    1.2 Alpha diversity
#    1.3 Taxonomic and functional profiling
# 2) METABOLISM OF THE TLT
#    2.1 Extraction of scopes for metagenomic data (MetaG-GEMs)
#    2.2 Extraction of scopes for genomic data (MAG-GEMs)
#    2.3 Conversion of scopes into MXs
#    2.4 Draw: boxplot
#    2.5 Draw: flowchart
#    2.6 Draw: PCoA
#    2.7 Draw: heatmap
